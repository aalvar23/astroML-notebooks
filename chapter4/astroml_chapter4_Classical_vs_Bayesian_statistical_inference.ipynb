    "- Parameters (such as the fraction of coin flips, for a certain coin, that are heads) are fixed, unknown constants. Because they are not fluctuating, probability statements about parameters are meaningless.\n",

    "- Statistical procedures should have well-defined long-run frequency properties. For example, a 95% confidence interval should bracket the true value of the parameter with a limiting frequency of at least 95%.\n",

Models are denoted $M(\\theta)$ where $\\theta$ is a set of model parameters.\n",
