AstroML notebooks
-----------------

This section makes available the source code used to generate the figures
in the book `Statistics, Data Mining, and Machine Learning in Astronomy`,
curated into stand alone notebook format. The focus is on the later chapters that
have actual applications using astronomical data.
Narrative commentary is provided, however some sections maybe less
self-explanatory without the book as a reference.
The table of contents of the book can be seen :download:`here(pdf)
